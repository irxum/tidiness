The variables in the key_meas_tidy data are explained below:

"activity"
This is the activity performed in the study.  The possible activities are:
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

"subject"
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.  
The volunteers were assigned identifiers from 1 to 30.

"variable"
The "variable" column details the name of measurement.  There are 66 variables come from measurements
made by the smartphone sensors.  The variable name indicate if the value is the mean or standard deviation.
A t at the beginning of the name indicates time whereas the f indicates Fast Fourier Transform.
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

"value"
Average of the measurements for each activity and subject. These values are unit-less
because they the full raw dataset is normalized.

Summary choices:

This is considered a tidy dataset because it fulfills the three conditions:
  - Each variable measured in one column
  - Each different observation of variable in different row.
  - One table (the text file) for each kind of variable
This tidy dataset is similar in format to the tidy version of the dataset found in 
the reshaping data lecture.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been 
randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training 
data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled 
in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, 
which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into 
body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, 
therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained 
by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
